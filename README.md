# TSP-PSO

## PSO Algorithm for Travelling Salesman Problem
This repository contains an implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in C#. The algorithm uses a position-based ranking approach to guide the search. 

## Requirements
This implementation was written in C# and requires .NET Core 3.1 or higher to run.
